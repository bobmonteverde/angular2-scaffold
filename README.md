# Angular2 Scaffold

Work in progress.

Attempting to create a boilerplate for Angular2 that utilizes Gulp, jspm, TypeScript, PostCSS (temporaily supporting SASS), BrowserSync and a few other tools.  An attempt to allow people to play with Angular2 on a cutting edge front end stack with as much automation as possible.

Once complete, will likely turn into a Yeoman Generator.
